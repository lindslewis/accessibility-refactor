## Description

In order to increase accessibility and longevity of this webpage, I refactored with those two keys in mind. 
The original codes in both the style.css and index.html files was extremely busy and difficult to read. There was a lot of redundancy, which would make it difficult for future changes and developers to continue work on this page. Thus, it was necessary to combine elements, reduce classes, add comments: these all also contribute to better site accessibility and usability. 
I learned how to better think about my code with accessibility in mind, so watching descriptions of ID's, classes, and semantic elements.

In the header, there are links to each section of the main body. These links are referred to as **Search Engine Optimization**, **Online Reputation Management**, and **Social Media Marketing**.
