#accessibility-refactor#

## Description

In order to increase accessibility and longevity of this webpage, I refactored with those two keys in mind. 
The original codes in both the style.css and index.html files was extremely busy and difficult to read. There was a lot of redundancy, which would make it difficult for future changes and developers to continue work on this page. Thus, it was necessary to combine elements, reduce classes, add comments: these all also contribute to better site accessibility and usability. 
I learned how to better think about my code with accessibility in mind, so watching descriptions of ID's, classes, and semantic elements. 


## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)

    ```
## Usage

In the header, there are links to each section of the main body. These links are referred to as **Search Engine Optimization**, **Online Reputation Management**, and **Social Media Marketing**. These links at the top of the page will bring you to their relevant section in the main body of the webpage.

## Credits

The original webpage that needed refactoring was provided by Trilogy Education Services.
A tutorial for the ReadMe was followed, provided by [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
Information was also gleaned from [SemRush](https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/).
